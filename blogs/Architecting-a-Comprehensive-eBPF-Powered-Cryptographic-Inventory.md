**Main Takeaway:** By integrating eBPF into a modular, scalable solution architecture, organizations can achieve a live, tamperresistant cryptographic inventory—enabling continuous risk assessment, seamless compliance, and efficient migration to post-quantum cryptography.

## 1. Introduction  
In a world where every bit of data may face increasingly sophisticated attacks—or be rendered vulnerable by quantum computing advances—organizations need more than static snapshots of their cryptographic posture. They require a **dynamic, real-time inventory** that captures algorithms, keys, certificates, and protocols in use across every layer of their infrastructure. eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) provides the perfect kernel-level instrumentation framework to achieve this, offering minimal overhead, built-in safety, and deep visibility into both user-space and kernel-space operations.

This blog deepens the discussion by detailing a complete solution architecture: from eBPF probe development to data collection pipelines, storage design, analytics dashboards, and integration with compliance workflows.

## 2. What Is a Cryptographic Inventory—and Why It Matters  
A **cryptographic inventory** is the authoritative catalog of every cryptographic artifact across your environment:

- **Algorithms & Cipher Suites** (RSA-2048, AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)  
- **Key Material** (public/private keys, ephemeral session keys)  
- **Certificates** (X.509 metadata, expiration dates, issuers)  
- **Libraries & Frameworks** (OpenSSL, BoringSSL, Go’s crypto/tls)  
- **Protocols & Endpoints** (TLS/SSL versions, SSH configurations, IPsec)  

Without this inventory, organizations can’t:
1. **Assess Risk**: Spot outdated or broken algorithms.  
2. **Meet Regulations**: Prove compliance with GDPR, NIS2, SEC requirements, and upcoming post-quantum mandates.  
3. **Plan Migration**: Sequence upgrades from vulnerable algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC) to post-quantum schemes (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber).

## 3. Limitations of Traditional Discovery Methods  
| Traditional Method         | Blind Spots                                              | Drawbacks                                           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Static Code Analysis       | Misses runtime-loaded libraries, in-memory keys          | Labor-intensive rescans, manual updates             |
| Certificate Scanning       | Only tests externally exposed endpoints                  | Doesn’t uncover ephemeral or internal certificates  |
| Network Packet Capture     | Sees only ciphertext; needs decryption or MITM setup     | Performance bottlenecks, risks policy violations    |

These approaches leave **dark regions**: containerized microservices loading libraries at runtime, ephemeral TLS session keys, or embedded crypto in closed-source components.

## 4. End-to-End Solution Architecture  

### 4.1. eBPF Probe Layer  
- **kprobes & kretprobes**: Hook kernel functions like `crypto_alloc_skcipher`, `sk_evict_skcipher`, and `crypto_skcipher_encrypt` to log algorithm selection, key lengths, and operation outcomes.  
- **uprobes**: Attach to user-space calls such as `SSL_CTX_new()`, `SSL_set_cipher_list()`, and Go’s `crypto/tls.(*Conn).Handshake()` to capture context before and after crypto operations.  
- **eBPF Maps**: Use per-process hash maps to accumulate metadata (algorithm names, key sizes, process IDs, thread IDs).

**Design Considerations:**  
- Keep probe programs under 4 KB of BPF bytecode to satisfy the kernel verifier.  
- Enforce strict event filters (e.g., only TLS ports 443/8443) to reduce noise and performance impact.

### 4.2. Data Ingestion & Transformation  
1. **Ring Buffer & Perf Events**: eBPF writes events into a high-speed ring buffer, enabling user-space daemons to consume with sub-millisecond latency.  
2. **Collector Daemon**: A lightweight Go or Rust service reads perf events, enriches them via `/proc/[pid]` to fetch binary path, container ID, and cgroup information.  
3. **Normalization Pipeline**: Events are normalized into a JSON schema:  
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-07-24T13:45:30Z",
     "process": "/usr/bin/nginx",
     "pid": 1234,
     "container": "service-frontend-abcde",
     "algorithm": "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
     "key_length": 128,
     "certificate_subject": "CN=api.example.com,O=Example Corp",
     "operation": "encrypt"
   }
   ```

### 4.3. Storage & Indexing  
- **Time-Series Database (TSDB)**: Store high-volume event streams (timestamps, key sizes, cipher names) in InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for fast aggregation and trend analysis.  
- **Document Store**: Archive certificate and library metadata in MongoDB or Elasticsearch for ad-hoc querying and full-text search.  
- **Data Lake**: Offload raw event streams to S3 or HDFS for long-term retention and audit.

### 4.4. Analytics & Dashboard  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards illustrating algorithm usage over time, certificate expirations, and anomaly detection (e.g., unexpected use of weak ciphers).  
- **Alerting**: Prometheus alerts for deprecated algorithm usage or certificates expiring within 30 days.  
- **Reporting API**: Expose a RESTful interface for security teams to query inventory by asset type, expiration window, or algorithm risk category.

## 5. Post-Quantum Migration Workflow  
1. **Discovery Phase**: Identify systems using classical algorithms (RSA, ECDSA).  
2. **Risk Scoring**: Assign risk levels—high (RSA-2048), medium (ECDSA-P256), low (AES-256).  
3. **Pilot Upgrade**: Deploy PQC libraries (e.g., liboqs, BoringSSL-pqc) in non-production environments, using eBPF to validate correct negotiation of CRYSTALS-Kyber or Dilithium.  
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment with built-in rollback via feature flags.  
5. **Validation & Audit**: Continuous eBPF monitoring to ensure new algorithms are in use, with automated compliance reports.

## 6. Performance, Security, and Governance Considerations  
- **Minimal Overhead:** Benchmarks show <1% CPU impact under 10 Gbps loads when filtering events by port and binary whitelist.  
- **Tamper-Resistance:** Kernel-enforced eBPF sandboxing ensures probes cannot be modified at runtime without root and BPF_CAP privileges.  
- **Privacy:** Only metadata is collected; plaintext and key material are never logged.  
- **RBAC & Access Control:** Define IAM policies for who can deploy probes, read inventory data, and generate compliance reports.
